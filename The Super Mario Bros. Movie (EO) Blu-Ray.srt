1
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,880
Jen la reĝo de la tesdudoj!

2
00:02:40,161 --> 00:02:43,281
Malfermu la pordojn aŭ mortiĝu!

3
00:03:02,963 --> 00:03:04,242
Ataku!

4
00:03:19,203 --> 00:03:21,843
Tio estas nur peco de nia kolero.

5
00:03:21,924 --> 00:03:23,844
Ĉu vi rezignas?

6
00:03:26,844 --> 00:03:28,084
Ne.

7
00:03:51,246 --> 00:03:52,206
Ne.

8
00:04:25,847 --> 00:04:27,807
Mi finfine trovis ĝin.

9
00:04:27,888 --> 00:04:31,207
Kaj nun, neniu povas halti min!

10
00:04:44,049 --> 00:04:45,809
Estas mi, Mario!

11
00:04:45,888 --> 00:04:47,008
Kaj Luigi!

12
00:04:47,089 --> 00:04:49,329
Ĉu vi estas laca pro multekosta tubriparo?

13
00:04:49,409 --> 00:04:50,849
Mamma mia!

14
00:04:50,929 --> 00:04:52,969
Tial la Superaj Fratoj Mario estas ĉi tie,

15
00:04:53,049 --> 00:04:55,089
por savi Broklinon,
kaj Kvinzon,

16
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:56,249
kaj vian monujon!

17
00:04:56,329 --> 00:04:57,848
Dankon, Superaj Fratoj Mario.

18
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:01,450
Ŝajnas, ke la sola afero, kiu vi ne drenis, estas mia bankokonto.

19
00:05:01,529 --> 00:05:05,089
Forgesu la multekostajn tubriparajn
kompaniojn, kiuj ne konas vin.

20
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:08,170
Kun la Superaj Fratoj Mario, vi
estas familiano!

21
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:09,689


22
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:11,650


23
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:13,249
Ŭaŭ! Vi estis bona!

24
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:15,009
Ĉu mi estis bona?
Ĉu vi blagas min?

25
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:16,649
Vi estis bonega!

26
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:19,810
Mi tre ĝojas, ke ni investis nian
vivŝparaĵon por ĉi tiu anonco.

27
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:23,130
Tio ne estas anonco! Tio estas kinaĵo.

28
00:05:23,211 --> 00:05:25,931
Kia estis la akĉento?
Ĉu ĝi estas tro?

29
00:05:26,011 --> 00:05:28,411
Tro? Ĝi estas perfekta!

30
00:05:28,491 --> 00:05:29,531
Ŭahu!

31
00:05:29,612 --> 00:05:30,972
Bone, mi kredas vin.

32
00:05:31,051 --> 00:05:32,651
Kiom mirinda.

33
00:05:32,732 --> 00:05:37,048
Jen la ŝatataj fiaskuloj de Broklino, la
Malsuperaj Fratoj Mario.

34
00:05:37,292 --> 00:05:38,892
Ho, ve. Spike estas ĉi tie.

35
00:05:38,971 --> 00:05:40,211
Hej, Spike.

36
00:05:40,292 --> 00:05:43,451
Jes.
"Estas mi!"

37
00:05:43,532 --> 00:05:45,891
Fu, jes.

38
00:05:45,972 --> 00:05:49,252
Tell me,
have you even gotten one call
Diru al mi, ĉu vi ricevis eĉ
unu telefonadon

39
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:51,653
ekde vi forlasis min por
komenci vian stultan kompanion?

40
00:05:51,732 --> 00:05:54,892
Fakte, Spike, jes.

41
00:05:54,973 --> 00:05:56,973
Ŭaŭ. Ĉu vere?
Ho, jes.

42
00:05:57,052 --> 00:05:58,012
Nia patrino
telefonis,

43
00:05:58,093 --> 00:06:01,573
kaj ŝi diris, "Ho, fiĉjoj, tio estas
la plej bona anonco, kiun mi vidis!"

44
00:06:01,653 --> 00:06:04,493
Kaj mi diris, "Dankegon, panjo, ni estas
tre ĝoja pri ĝi."

45
00:06:04,574 --> 00:06:06,133
Do, bum!

46
00:06:07,454 --> 00:06:09,133


47
00:06:09,214 --> 00:06:12,253
Bonŝancon administri
negocon kun ĉi tiu stultulo.

48
00:06:12,334 --> 00:06:16,093
Se vi rediros tion pri mia
frato, vi bedaŭros.

49
00:06:18,294 --> 00:06:19,614
Ho, jes?

50
00:06:20,374 --> 00:06:23,133
Metu ĉi tion en vian etan cerbon, Mario.

51
00:06:23,694 --> 00:06:27,614
Vi estas ridinda, kaj ĉiam estos.

52
00:06:31,295 --> 00:06:32,655


53
00:06:34,055 --> 00:06:35,335


54
00:06:35,415 --> 00:06:36,575
Ĉu vi estas
freneza?

55
00:06:36,655 --> 00:06:38,375
Li estas trioble pli granda
ol vi.

56
00:06:38,456 --> 00:06:39,575
Luigi, ho ve.

57
00:06:39,655 --> 00:06:41,415
Vi ne povas timi ĉiam.

58
00:06:41,495 --> 00:06:42,935
Vi estus surprizita.

59
00:06:48,895 --> 00:06:51,175
Saluton, Superaj Fratoj Mario.

60
00:06:51,256 --> 00:06:52,456
Aha.

61
00:06:52,536 --> 00:06:54,856
Ĉu via krano gutas? Bonege!

62
00:06:54,936 --> 00:06:56,895
Mi diras, estas bonege, ke vi
telefonas nin,

63
00:06:56,977 --> 00:06:59,456
ĉar ni povas esti tie kaj ripari
ĝin tuj. Bone.

64
00:06:59,537 --> 00:07:01,457
Mario, ni ricevis unu!

65
00:07:01,536 --> 00:07:05,736
La Superaj Fratoj Mario komercas!
Hura!

66
00:07:07,337 --> 00:07:08,576


67
00:07:10,777 --> 00:07:11,737


68
00:07:12,497 --> 00:07:14,216


69
00:07:14,297 --> 00:07:15,777
Ho, ve. Ni malfruos.

70
00:07:15,858 --> 00:07:17,817
Ne, ni ne malfruos. Ek. Ni iru.

71
00:07:17,898 --> 00:07:19,137


72
00:07:19,217 --> 00:07:20,177
Hej, atendu.

73
00:07:20,258 --> 00:07:21,257
Ĉi tien.

74
00:07:22,698 --> 00:07:23,778


75
00:07:23,858 --> 00:07:25,698
Venu, Lu. Ne timu

76
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:27,418


77
00:07:27,498 --> 00:07:28,617
Pardonpetu.

78
00:07:29,138 --> 00:07:31,058
Havu!

79
00:07:33,538 --> 00:07:34,858


80
00:07:34,939 --> 00:07:36,178


81
00:07:36,258 --> 00:07:38,058
Ve, Mario. Kion vi faras?

82
00:07:41,499 --> 00:07:42,459


83
00:07:42,539 --> 00:07:44,658
Hej! Iru el tie.

84
00:07:46,179 --> 00:07:47,779


85
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:49,379
Vi ne povas esti en- Ho!

86
00:07:49,459 --> 00:07:50,859
Mia kulpo!

87
00:07:50,939 --> 00:07:52,979
Foriru!
Pardonon.

88
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:54,739
Ni laboras ĉi tie!
Pardonegon.

89
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:01,499
Ek, Luigi. Ekzercu tiujn krurojn

90
00:08:01,581 --> 00:08:03,340
Mi penas. Mi penas.

91
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:05,099
Miaj genuoj doloras.

92
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:14,100
Ho, ŭaŭ. Ni sukcesis.

93
00:08:16,021 --> 00:08:18,220
The drip is right upstairs
at the end of the hall.

94
00:08:18,301 --> 00:08:20,101
-Can you fix it?
-[Mario] Very confident, sir.

95
00:08:20,181 --> 00:08:21,981
You'll be careful about making a mess?

96
00:08:22,061 --> 00:08:24,341
Ma'am, I assure you,
we don't make messes.

97
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:26,342
We fix 'em. [chuckles]

98
00:08:27,302 --> 00:08:28,541
That's Francis.

Mm-hmm. [smacks lips]
And a first job complete.

108

00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:04,226
[chuckles] It's the Super Mario Brothers,
from the TV!

147
00:11:06,951 --> 00:11:08,750
They give an Oscar for worst actors?

-[laughs] What'd I do?

So everybody saw the commercial then?

Well, I thought it was incredible.

155
00:11:22,192 --> 00:11:23,871
It belongs in a movie theater.

156
00:11:25,112 --> 00:11:26,312
Ugh, mushrooms?

157
00:11:26,392 --> 00:11:28,312
Everybody loves mushrooms, right?

What were you thinking
with that commercial?

What? It's supposed to be funny.

-Yeah, but what's with the outfits?

That's right, you gotta have a trademark.
Gotta stand out.

165

Don't listen to them.
